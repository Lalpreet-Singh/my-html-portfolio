<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I successfully developed and deployed an AI-powered plant disease prediction system that achieved 99% model accuracy, demonstrating my ability to build practical machine learning solutions end-to-end. This project also showcased my skills in CNNs, Streamlit, and Docker, and reflected my commitment to creating scalable, user-friendly applications.</p>

<p>During my tenure at iCUERIOUS, I earned a full-time Research Analyst role after starting as an intern, based on consistent performance, attention to detail, and high-quality technical documentation. I delivered clear claim charts, precise infringement analyses, and well-structured reports that supported litigation teams and improved workflow efficiency.</p>

<p>I strengthened my technical foundation by completing multiple hands-on internships and trainings in C++, DSA, IoT, and machine learning. Through these experiences, I demonstrated the ability to quickly learn new technologies, apply them to real-world problems, and contribute meaningfully to academic and industry-level projects.</p>
